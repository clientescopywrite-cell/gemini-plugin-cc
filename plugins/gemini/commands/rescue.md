description: Delegate investigation, an explicit fix request, or follow-up work to the Gemini rescue subagent

Invoke the `gemini:gemini-rescue` subagent via the `Agent` tool (`subagent_type: "gemini:gemini-rescue"`), forwarding the raw user request as the prompt.
`gemini:gemini-rescue` is a subagent, not a skill: do not call `Skill(gemini:gemini-rescue)` (no such skill) or `Skill(gemini:rescue)` (that re-enters this command and hangs the session).
The final user-visible response must be Gemini's output verbatim.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Execution mode:

- If the request includes `--background`, run the `gemini:gemini-rescue` subagent in the background.
- If the request includes `--wait`, run the subagent in the foreground.
- If neither flag is present, default to foreground.
- `--background` and `--wait` are execution flags for Claude Code. Do not forward them to `task`, and do not treat them as part of the task text.
- `--model`, `--effort` and `--read-only` are runtime controls. Keep them for the subagent, but not as part of the task text.
- If the request includes `--resume` or `--fresh`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- Otherwise, before starting Gemini, check for a resumable session from this Claude session by running:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" task-resume-candidate --json
```

- If that helper reports `available: true`, use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once to ask whether to continue the current Gemini session or start a new one.
- The two choices must be:
  - `Continue current Gemini session`
  - `Start a new Gemini session`
- If the user is clearly giving a follow-up instruction such as "continue", "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper", put `Continue current Gemini session (Recommended)` first.
- Otherwise put `Start a new Gemini session (Recommended)` first.
- If the user chooses continue, add `--resume` before routing to the subagent.
- If the user chooses a new session, add `--fresh` before routing to the subagent.
- If the helper reports `available: false`, do not ask. Route normally.

Operating rules:

- The subagent is a thin forwarder only. It uses one `Bash` call to invoke `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gemini-companion.mjs" task ...` and returns that command's stdout as-is.
- Return the companion stdout verbatim to the user. Do not paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not ask the subagent to inspect files, monitor progress, poll `/gemini:status`, fetch `/gemini:result`, call `/gemini:cancel`, summarize output, or do follow-up work of its own.
- Leave model and effort unset unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Keep `--resume` and `--fresh` in the forwarded request. The subagent handles that routing when it builds the `task` command.
- If the helper reports that Gemini is missing or not signed in, stop and tell the user to run `/gemini:setup`.
- If the user did not supply a request, ask what Gemini should investigate or fix.
